# Roadmap

## Planning
- Confirm the documented minimal user flows meet day-to-day needs.

## Software foundation
- Implement the C# web UI shell and navigation for inventory tasks.
- Integrate WLED control endpoints for pick-by-light activation.
- Support multiple ESP32 targets across different racks.
- Persist inventory data without a database (e.g., JSON-backed storage).

## Usability and refinement
- Add search filters and quick-pick workflows.
- Improve labeling, calibration, and LED brightness profiles.
- Validate performance and reliability in day-to-day use.
- Expand maintenance flows for import/export and rich metadata.
